# UKHSA Standards Template Repository

Welcome to the UKHSA standards template repository.
This is a template repository that can be used by teams at UKHSA to create their own standards documentation and have
them published on the [UKHSA Engineering Standards website][1].

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template teams can use to define their own technical standards related to
their area of work.
This repository is pre-configured with tools, configurations, and workflows to check that the documentation conforms to
the necessary standards to be published.

## Using this repository

1. Navigate to [this repository][2] on GitHub
1. Click the *"Use this template"* button to create a new repository.

Or, when creating a new repository on GitHub, choose this repository in the dropdown box next to the
*"Start with a repository"* option.

Once you have created a new repository from this template, you can then start adding documentation to the `docs/`
directory.

### Repository Setup

After creating a new repository based on this template, please undertake the following steps:

1. Replace the template specific parts of this readme file with suitable readme documentation for your new repository.
1. Rename `docs/your-standards.11tydata.json`, replacing the `your-standards` part with the name to be used when
   published.
1. Run `npm install` from the root of this repository to install the dev dependencies.
1. Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines to meet your expectations for contributors. This file is currently written
   for the audience of the template repository so will need to changed.

### Creating your documentation

All your documentation should be written in Markdown in the `docs/` directory.
The documentation is published using [Eleventy][3] along with the [UK Gov Eleventy Plugin][4] for styling.

A basic `index.md` is provided which can be modified to provide the index page for your documentation.
At present, the `your-standards.11tydata.json` file is also provided which sets some common [front matter][5] for the pages
of documentation so that they are displayed in a [sub-navigation layout][6].
Of course if you want to use a different layout, you can.

### Committing your documentation

When committing your documentation, assuming you have successfully run `npm install` from the repository setup steps,
you will be provided with a commit message template with instructions on how to commit correctly.
If your commit message doesn't conform to the expectations described in the template your commit will be flagged as
having failed a build step by a commit linting GitHub action which runs whenever a commit is pushed to GitHub.
Please fix any failing commits!

Additionally on commit, a `pre-commit` hook runs to check that the documentation in the `docs/` directory conforms to
our predefined markdown formatting standards.
If it doesn't, then the commit will fail meaning you will need to fix the issues before creating the commit.
The output of the `pre-commit` hook will tell you what is wrong so you can manually fix issues, however, you can also
use the same tool which provides this linting to fix the issues:

```bash
# this is the pre-commit hook which runs to check if your markdown conforms
npx remark docs/ --ext .md --use remark-preset-lint-consistent --use remark-preset-lint-recommended --frail

# if you have issues you can run this command to fix the problems automatically
npx remark docs/ --ext .md --output
```

### Publishing your documentation

Contact a member of the [Org Standards Admins][7] team and they will add your repository to the [standards-org][8] repo.

## Local Publishing

To see how your docs look locally before publishing them you can use a container image:

```bash
docker run -p "8080:8080" -v "./docs:/site/docs/your-standards/" ghcr.io/ukhsa-collaboration/standards-org
```

*Replace `your-standards` with the path you'd like to expose your docs at.*

After running this command you can view your docs by going to [http://localhost:8080/your-standards/][9], again
replacing `your-standards` with the path you specified previously.
While this docker command is running it will notice when files change and update them so you can see how they look live.
