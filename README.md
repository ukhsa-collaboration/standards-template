# UKHSA Standards Template Repository

Welcome to the UKHSA standards template repository.
This is a template repository that can be used by teams at UKHSA to create their own standards documentation and have
them published on the [UKHSA Engineering Standards website][1].

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template teams can use to define their own technical standards related to
their area of work.
This repository is pre-configured with tools, configurations, and workflows to check that the documentation conforms to
the necessary standards to be published.

## Local Publishing

To see how your docs look locally before publishing them you can use a container image:

```bash
docker run -p "8080:8080" -v "./docs:/site/docs/your-standards" ukhsa-std-harness
```

*Replace `your-standards` with the path you'd like to expose your docs at.*

After running this command you can view your docs by going to [http://localhost:8080/your-standards/][3], again replacing
`your-standards` with the path you specified previously.
While this docker command is running it will notice when files change and update them so you can see how they look live.
