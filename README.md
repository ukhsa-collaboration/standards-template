# UKHSA Standards Template Repository

Welcome to the UKHSA standards template repository.
This is a template repository that can be used by teams at UKHSA to create their own standards documentation and have
them published on the [UKHSA Engineering Standards website][1].

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template teams can use to define their own technical standards related to
their area of work.
This repository is pre-configured with tools, configurations, and workflows to check that the documentation conforms to
the necessary standards to be published.

## Using this repository

1. Navigate to [this repository][2] on GitHub
1. Click the *"Use this template"* button to create a new repository.

Or, when creating a new repository on GitHub, choose this repository in the dropdown box next to the
*"Start with a repository"* option.

Once you have created a new repository from this template, you can then start adding documentation to the `docs/`
directory.

### Repository Setup

After creating a new repository based on this template, please undertake the following steps:

1. Replace the template specific parts of this readme file with suitable readme documentation for your new repository.
1. Rename `docs/your-standards.11tydata.json`, replacing the `your-standards` part with the name to be used when
   published.
1. Run `npm install` from the root of this repository to install the dev dependencies.

### Creating your documentation

All your documentation should be written in Markdown in the `docs/` directory.
The documentation is published using [Eleventy][3] along with the [UK Gov Eleventy Plugin][4] for styling.

A basic `index.md` is provided which can be modified to provide the index page for your documentation.
At present, the `your-standards.11tydata.json` file is also provided which sets some common [front matter][5] for the pages
of documentation so that they are displayed in a [sub-navigation layout][6].
Of course if you want to use a different layout, you can.

### Publishing your documentation

Contact a member of the [Org Standards Admins][7] team and they will add your repository to the [standards-org][8] repo.

## Local Publishing

To see how your docs look locally before publishing them you can use a container image:

```bash
docker run -p "8080:8080" -v "./docs:/site/docs/your-standards/" ghrc.io/ukhsa-collaboration/standards-org
```

*Replace `your-standards` with the path you'd like to expose your docs at.*

After running this command you can view your docs by going to [http://localhost:8080/your-standards/][9], again
replacing `your-standards` with the path you specified previously.
While this docker command is running it will notice when files change and update them so you can see how they look live.
